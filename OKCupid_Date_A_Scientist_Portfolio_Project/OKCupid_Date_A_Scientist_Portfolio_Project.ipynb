        "In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we’ve never had before about how different people experience romance.\r\n",

        "You will also create a presentation about your findings from this OKCupid dataset.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing machine learning techniques to answer those questions. However, the questions you ask and how you answer them are entirely up to you."
